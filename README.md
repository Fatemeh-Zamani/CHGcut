# CHGcut
This code is related to our recently proposed method called CHGcut. This method can solve single individual haplotype problem for the both diploid and polyploid organisms
# Requirement:
This program is suitable for MATLAB R2013a and above versions. The program has adopted by Geraci's dataset. By some little change it can be used for any input data.

# Running the method
Please call HGHapCut_mec_RAX

The obtained results which includes the reconstruction rate and running time will be saved in some text files on the current path.

The details of used dataset can be accessible in the below paper:

F. Geraci, "A comparison of several algorithms for the single individual SNP haplotyping reconstruction problem," Bioinformatics, vol. 26, pp. 2217-2225, 2010.
